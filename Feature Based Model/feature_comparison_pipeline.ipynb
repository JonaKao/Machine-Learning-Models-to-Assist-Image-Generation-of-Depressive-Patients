    "The Purpose of this Notebook is to group the existing patient data into 4 groups based on their PHQ score, this grouping aims to analyze what facial actions are most correlated to sever depression, i.e high PHQ, and which AUs are most 'irrelevant'. To do this, we want to aggregate the values, once we have created our groupings, as well as calculate the ranges on which the AUs exist. "
